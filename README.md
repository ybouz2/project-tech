# Nanny's - Project Tech: Matching Application (Register/Login Feature)

![Nanny,s](/bannerimage.png)


This is the GitHub repository for my babysitter matching website feature. I decided to make the signup and login part of the website. 

## Job Story

"When I'm looking for a babysitter, I want to be able to create an account,  When I create an account, I prefer to be ready as soon as possible so that I can quickly start looking for a babysitter."

## Status

It was pretty diffucult to work with passport but at the end it worked. here is a list of future's:


*   Hashed password
*   Connection to a database to save all the information that users upload
*   Different backend validation, for example to make sure that multiple users can't have the same username

Things I might add in the future:


*   Password changing
*   Account changing
*   Add a profile picture
